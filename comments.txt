\section{Wigglez BAO Analaysis}





{\red explicitly state fiducial}

The analysis investigated in detail is that performed by \citet{BlakeDavis2011}, which tested cosmological models using the BAO signal at a redshift of $z=0.6$. The Wigglez correlation data points are determined using the 
\begin{equation}
\xi(s) = \frac{DD(s) - DR(s) + RR(s)}{RR(s)},
\end{equation}
where $D$ is used to denote the observed distribution and $R$ a random distribution
 The dataset used in this analysis differs from the dataset used in my analysis {\green first person still good for thesis?} in terms of uncertainty determination. \citet{BlakeDavis2011} utilised a series of lognormal realisations to estimate uncertainty in the binned data points. Lognormal realisations are reasonable accurate whilst the data remains in the linear and quasi-linear regimes, which is generally sufficient for analysis of large scale structure such as the BAO \citep{ColesJones1991}. The method of generating these realisations is detailed \citet{BlakeGlazebrook2003} and \citet{GlazebrookBlake2005}. In contrast to this, I will be using uncertainties derived from the WizCOLA simulations {\red I dont actually have any sources on this :s }. 



Similarly to \citet{EisensteinZehavi2005}, the model used by \citet{BlakeDavis2011} caters to two quasi-linear departures from the well known linear model - acoustic peak smoothing caused by displacement of matter due to bulk flows, and inclusion non-linear growth due to scale dependent growth rates \citep{EisensteinSeoWhite2007,CrocceScoccimarro2008,Matsubara2008}. The base linear model is generated by CAMB \citep{Lewis2000} with $\Omega_m$ a free parameter and other parameters fixed to fiducial cosmology: $h=0.71$, $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.0226$, $ n_s=0.96$, $\sigma_8=0.8$ which come from CMB data \citep{Komatsu2009} {\red should I set CAMB TO use these?}. A power spectrum without the BAO feature is also generated using the fitting formula from \citet{EisensteinHu1998}. The acoustic peak smoothing is catered for by blending the two models (linear and no BAO) via a Gaussian dampening term:
\begin{align} \label{{eq:blake1}}
P_{\rm{dw}}(k) = \exp(-k^2 \sigma_v^2) P_{\rm{lin}}(k) + (1 - \exp(-k^2 \sigma_v^2)) P_{\rm{nw}}(k),
\end{align}
where $P_{\rm{lin}}$ and $P_{\rm{nw}}(k)$ are respectively the linear power spectrum from CAMB and the no-wiggle (the BAO peak is visible as a wiggle in the power spectrum) power spectrum from the fitting formula by \citet{EisensteinHu1998}.
\citet{CrocceScoccimarro2008} showed the magnitude of the dampening can be given by
\begin{align}
\sigma_v^2 = \frac{1}{6\pi^2} \int P_L(k) dk,
\end{align}
and this theoretical value was used to ensure consistency with the determined $\sigma_v$ when it was allowed to vary as a free parameter in the model fitting.

The second effect on the model - the non-linear distortion of growth rate is included via the fitting formula from \citet{Smith2003}, such that the non-linear modification is given by
\begin{align}
P_{\rm{dw, NL}}(k) = \left( \frac{P_{\rm{NL}}}{P_{\rm{nw}}} \right) \times P_{\rm{dw}},
\end{align}
where $P_{\rm{NL}}$ is the output spectrum from \citet{Smith2003}. The power spectrum $P_{\rm{dw, NL}}(k)$ is then converted to a correlation function $\xi(s)$ via the spherical Hankel function, and a scale dependent bias was applied, such that
\begin{align}
\xi_{\rm{galaxy}}(s) = B(s) \xi(s),
\end{align}
where $B(s) = 1 + (s/s_0)^\gamma$, with $s_0 = 0.32 h^{-1}\,$Mpc and $\gamma = -1.36$, where this fit was determined using halo catalogues extracted from the GiggleZ dark matter simulation {\red note gigglez used WMAP not planck cosmology, so ask Tam if we should stick to WMAP because of this}. The magnitude of this correction ($\sim 1\%$) is far less than that found in more biased galaxy samples such as the SDSS LRG sample, which has corrections on the order of $\sim 10\%$ \citep{EisensteinZehavi2005}. The galaxy correlation function also has both a horizontal scale factor $\alpha$ and a vertical scale factor $b^2$ added in, to respectively allow corrections to the fiducial model and to account for galaxy bias, such that the final model is
\begin{align}
\xi_{\rm{final}}(s) = b^2 \xi_{\rm{galaxy}}(\alpha s).
\end{align}
This model then undergoes several rounds of minimum $\chi^2$ fitting with \textsc{CosmoMC} \citep{LewisBridle2002}, each round using a different dataset. Three datasets are detailed in the paper, using datapoints in the ranges $10 < s < 180 h^{-1}\ \rm{Mpc}$,$30 < s < 180 h^{-1}\ \rm{Mpc}$ and $50 < s < 180 h^{-1}\ \rm{Mpc}$ respectively. All fits were able to extract constraints on the parameter $D_v(z)$ {\red shit I havent talked about this in background. NOTE TO SELF. TALK ABOUT THIS}, but only the largest dataset provided the ability to accurately determine $\Omega_m h^2$. {\red COMPARE AND CONTRAST THIS WITH OTHERS AT END.} {\green Could talk about $D_V$ degeneracy as well if wanted.}

Taking the likelihood $\mathcal{L}$ as proportional to $\exp(-\chi^2 / 2)$, the most likely model (minimum $\chi^2$) parametrisations were refit to the data using the no wiggle spectrum to get new $\chi^2$ result, where the change in $\chi^2$ thus becomes an indicator of the significance of the BAO peak detection. They found $\Delta \chi^2 = 10.1$, which corresponds to a 3.2$\sigma$ significance detection of the BAO peak. {\green Same thing done but with no baryons (and then with even smaller range) and peak still significant.}

The potential for systematic error was evaluated by performing model fits with modified models so as to determine the effect on final cosmological parameters. The five models tested were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the theoretically determined $\sigma_v$ instead of having it as a free parameter.
\item Remove dampening of the BAO peak
\item Remove small scale power (such that $P_{\rm{nw}}(k)$ from equation \eqref{eq:blake1} is removed).
\item Use of an alternate formula to determine $P_{\rm{nw}}(k)$ from \citet{EisensteinSeoWhite2007}.
\item Introduce mode-coupling terms found in \citet{Sanchez2009}.
\end{enumerate}
They found that the constraints on $D_v(z)$ all highly agreed, indicating that systematics from one of these approaches is unlikely to be significantly affecting results. 

{\green Blake then moves onto power spectrum stuff (and other ways of detecting peak, Ill come back to this if I need)}



\section{SDSS LRG DR7 2D BAO Analyses}


The luminous red galaxy (LRG) dataset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has had many analyses conducted on it. In this section, two relevant papers will be investigated, both which investigate the 2D BAO signal present in the seventh data release of the LRG dataset \citep[DR7:][]{Abazajian2009}. The first is the investigation by \citet{ChuangWang2012}, and the second the analysis performed by \citet{Gaztanaga2009}.

{\red explicitly state fiducial}


\citet{ChuangWang2012} investigate the 2D BAO signal present in the seventh data release of SDSS, in effort to provide constraints on Hubble's constant $H(z)$ and angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. Similarly to \citet{BlakeDavis2011}, \citet{ChuangWang2012} compute the base linear power spectrum using CAMB \citep{Lewis2000} and no wiggle spectrum using \citet{EisensteinHu1998}, where a similar Gaussian dampening mixing formula is used:
\begin{align}
P_{dw}(k) = P_{lin}(k) \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{2k_*^2}\right) + P_{nw}(k)\left[ 1-  \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{2k_*^2}\right) \right],
\end{align}
where $k_*$ acts in an identical fashion to $\sigma_v$ discussed previously, such that $\sigma_v = \frac{1}{2} k_*^{-2}$. Set as a free parameter, $k_*$ is marginalised over the range of $0.09-0.13\  h^{-1}$ Mpc. Just as with $\sigma_v$, $k_*$ can be computed by renomalization perturbation theory \citep{CrocceScoccimarro2008,Matsubara2008}, however this requires knowing the amplitude of the power spectrum, which is also marginalised over. Nonlinear corrections are added to the spectrum also via use of the \textsc{halofit} software package provided by \citet{Smith2003} in an identical method to \citet{BlakeDavis2011}. Given small angle approximation (applicable for the scales of interest), the 2D correlation function can be written as \citep{Kaiser1987,Hamilton1992}
\begin{align}
\xi^*(\sigma, \pi) = \xi_0(s) P_0(\mu) + \xi_2(s) P_2(\mu) + \xi_4(s) P_4(\mu),
\end{align}
where $s = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \pi^2}$, $\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between $s=(\sigma,\pi)$ and the line of sight, and $P_l$ are Legendre polynomials. The multipoles of $\xi$ are defined as
\begin{align}
\xi_0(s) &= \left( 1 + \frac{2\beta}{3} + \frac{\beta^2}{5} \right) \xi(s), \\
\xi_2(s) &= \left(\frac{4\beta}{3} + \frac{4\beta^2}{7} \right) \left[ \xi(s) - \bar{\xi}(s) \right], \\
\xi_4(s) &= \frac{8 \beta^2}{35} \left( \xi(s) + \frac{5}{2} \bar{\xi}(s) - \frac{7}{2}\bar{\bar{\xi}} \right)
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is the redshift space distortion parameter {\red CLARIFY WHAT THIS MEANS, is this normal $\beta$ param or something else?} and 
\begin{align}
\bar{\xi}(s) &= \frac{3}{s^3} \int_0^s \xi(s^{\prime}) s^{\prime 2} ds' \\
\bar{\bar{\xi}}(s) &= \frac{5}{s^5} \int_0^s \xi(s^{\prime}) s^{\prime 4} ds'
\end{align}
\citet{ChuangWang2012} then take pairwise velocity dispersion into account by convolving the 2D correlation function
\begin{align}
\xi(\sigma, \pi) = \int_\infty^\infty \xi^* \left(\sigma, \pi - \frac{v}{H(z) a(z)} \right) f(v)\, dv,
\end{align} 
following \citet{Peebles1980}, where the random motions take exponential form \citep{RatcliffeShanks1998,Landy2002}
\begin{align}
f(v) = \frac{1}{\sigma_v \sqrt{2}} \exp\left(- \frac{\sqrt{2}\abs{v}}{\sigma_v} \right)
\end{align}
where $\sigma_v$ is the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion, and not to be confused with the $\sigma_v$ denoted in the Gaussian dampening used by \citet{BlakeDavis2011}. As before, horizontal and vertical scaling factors are added into the model.

Due to redshift distortion and galaxy bias (which the constructed model does not handle at small scales) and noisy data from sample variance at large scales, they conservatively truncated the data set and fit between the range $40 < s < 120 h^{-1}$ Mpc. Wide angle effects are not considered in the analysis as they have been shown to be small on the length scales of interest here \citep{SamushiaPercival2012} in comparison to the statistical errors. {\red ENSURE I CAN USE THIS RESULT AS WELL}.

The covariance matrix used for the SDSS LRG DR7 dataset are estimated using mock catalogues from the LasDamas simulations \citep{McBride2011}. Again, likelihood taken to be proportional to $\exp(-\chi^2/2)$ \citep{Press1992}. Like \citet{BlakeDavis2011}, fits were determined by using \textsc{CosmoMC}\citep{LewisBridle2002}, and it is important to note that \citet{ChuangWang2012} explored a greater parameter space than \citet{BlakeDavis2011}, where the modelling has free variables $H$, $D_A$, $\Omega_m h^2$, $\Omega_b h^2$, $\Omega_b h^2$, $\beta$, $n_s$, $\sigma_v$, $k_*$, where only $H$, $D_A$, $\Omega_m h^2$ were found to be well constrained by SDSS data. Flat priors were assigned to these parameters prior to fitting, with the lower and upper bounds as follows: $\beta: (0.1, 0.6)$, $\Omega_b h^2: (0.01859, 0.02657)$, $n_s: (0.865, 1.059)$, $\sigma_v: (0, 500)$ km s$^{-1}$, $k_*: (0.09, 0.13) h^{-1}$ Mpc, which correspond for $\Omega_b h^2$ and $n_s$ to WMAP7 results $\pm7\sigma$ \citep{Komatsu2011}.  \citet{ChuangWang2012} then present results for their fits for $H(z)$, $D_A(z)$, $\Omega_m h^2$ at $z=0.35$, and derived parameters $D_V(z)$ and $A(z)$ {\red NOTE TO MYSELF: also cover acoustic parameter in background}

{\red can come back to detailing their results if needed}








The analysis performed by \citet{Gaztanaga2009} also seeks to extract $H(z)$ from the LRG dataset. It follows similar model construction to that found in \citet{ChuangWang2012}, but attempt to take into account more sources of bias for their model, and so this is where the literature review will start for this paper. Similarly to above, \citet{Gaztanaga2009} state the power spectrum $P(k)$ and correlation function  $\xi$  are related via Fourier transformation
\begin{align}
\xi(\sigma, \pi) = \int P_s(k) e^{-ikr} \frac{d^3 k}{(2\pi)^3}.
\end{align}
Distortions to the distribution caused by coherent infall velocities can be modelled simply in Fourier space \citep{Kaiser1987}:
\begin{align} \label{eq:gaztanga1}
P_s(\vec{k}) = (1 + \beta \mu^2)^2 P_{gg}(k),
\end{align}
where $P_{gg}$ is the power spectrum of galaxy density fluctuations $\delta_g$, $\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between $\vec{k}$ and line of sight, the subscript $s$ indicates redshift space, and $\beta$ is the growth rate of growing modes in linear theory. Using the assumption that galaxy over density is linearly biased by a factor of $b$, $\beta$ can be approximated as \citep{Hamilton1992}
\begin{align}
\beta \approx \frac{\Omega_m^{0.55}}{b}
\end{align}

Redshift space distortions are accounted for using dispersion models, wherein the correlation function is convolved with a distribution of pairwise velocities given by $\sigma_v$, where the specifics of this distribution are detailed in \citet{CabreGaztanaga2009II}. \citet{Gaztanaga2009} also investigate the effects of magnification bias on the model. Two main effects are discussed: gravitational lensing increasing brightness via magnification and also increases apparent area (corresponding to a decrease in number density of galaxies). The net effect of these two factors is called magnification bias, and can be accounted for by determining the slope of the number counts over galaxy magnitude \citep{TurnerOstriker1984,  WebsterHewett1988, Fugmann1988, Narayan1989, Schneider1989, BroadhurstTaylor1995, MoessnerJain1998}:
\begin{align}
s = \frac{d \log_{10} N(<m)}{dm},
\end{align}
where $N(<m)$ refers to the number of galaxies in the survey with apparent magnitude brighter than $m$. \citet{Gaztanaga2009} utilises the photometric dataset from SDSS DR6 \citep[DR6:][]{Adelman2008} to estimate this slope within and beyond the spectroscopic limit, and from this applied corrections for magnification bias. For a more detailed derivation of the magnification bias effects, see \citet[Sec. 2.2]{Gaztanaga2009}.


{\green Summary here, seems like too in depth: Observed galaxy overdensity $\delta_{obs}$ related to trye galaxy overdensity $\delta_g$ by
\begin{align}
s\delta_{obs} = \delta_g + \delta_\mu,
\end{align}
where $\delta_mu = (5s - 2)\kappa$, with $\kappa$ being the lensing convergence which is simply a weighted LOS integral of the mass fluctuation $\delta_m$ (see \citet{HuiGaztanaga2007} for details). Linear redshift distortions by perculiar motion is straightforward:
\begin{align}
\delta_{obs} = \delta_g + \delta_\mu + \delta_v,
\end{align}
where $\delta_v = (1 + \bar{z})H(\bar{z})^{-1} \frac{\partial v_\pi}{\partial \pi}$ where $\bar{z}$ is the mean redshift, $v_\pi$ being the perculiar velocity in the $\pi$ direction. Squaring this equation and using the Limber approximation and linear theory to remove cross terms (see \citet{Matsubara2000, HuiGaztanaga2008} for details), we get
\begin{align}
\xi_{obs} = \xi_{gg} + \xi_{gv} + \xi_{vg} + \xi_{vv} + \xi_{g\mu} + \xi_{\mu g} + \xi_{\mu \mu}
\end{align}
First term is true signal, next three terms account for the Kaiser effect. Four terms together are real space analogue of \eqref{eq:gaztanga1}. Rest of terms account of magnification bias (very small at moderate redshifts (which are of interest)), so only focus on galaxy-magnification cross terms \citep{HuiGaztanaga2008,HuiGaztanaga2007}. Via Taylor expansion, find
\begin{align}
\xi_{g\mu}(\chi_1, \theta_1; \chi_2, \theta_2) + \xi_{\mu g}(\chi_1, \theta_1; \chi_2, \theta_2) = \frac{3}{2}H_0^2 \Omega_m(5s - 2) (1 + \bar{z}) \abs{\chi_1 - \chi_2} \int \frac{d^2k_\perp}{(2\pi)^2} P_{gm}(\bar{z}, k_\perp) e^{ik_\perp \bar{\chi}(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}
\end{align}
where$P_{gm}$ is the galaxy mass power spectrum. These lensing corrections are subject to more adjustment and scrutiny and in the rest of this section and section 2.3, but I won't go into as much detail.}

Estimation of $\xi(\sigma, \pi)$ is done using the \citet{LandySzalay1993} estimator with random catalogue 20 times denser than SDSS catalog and using the small angle approximation (accurate up to scales of approximately 10 degrees \citep{Szapudi2004, Matsubara2000Correlation}). Similar results were found when an alternate estimator based on pixel density fluctuations (ie \citet{BarrigaGaztanaga2002}) was used. Covariance is calculated with the use of 216 mock catalogues (MICEL7860, see \citet{FosalbaGaztanaga2008, CrocceFosalbaCastander2010} for details), and is compared to Jack-knife error and analytic error estimation. Agreement between comparisons validated the analytic error model, which is used in rest of paper. 

The monopole moment of the correlation function is fitted in the range $s > 20 h^{-1}$ Mpc, where magnification bias is not included in the model correction due to small effect on monopole at the intermediate redshift being looked at.

Bunch of systematic tests done, peak significant determined by $\chi^2$ comparison to null model, $>3\sigma$.

 {\green Insufficient detail in the sections on determining $H(z)$ for me to be able to follow it, hopefully if Tam shows me how it should be done I can use that the infer what they have done}.

{\red update: theres some stuff on how to extract $H(z)$ and other stuff, but I still dont understand it. wish they had some more information on whether using monopole/quad/combined/something else, and what they fitting to. come back to this maybe after reading some more studies, see if that helps}.












\section{BOSS CMASS DR9 BAO Analyses}


Many analyses have been performed on the ninth data release \citep[DR9;][]{AhnAlexandroff2012}
of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey \citep[BOSS;][]{DawsonSchlegel2013}, which is part of SDSS-III \citep{EisensteinWeinberg2011}. In this section, two studies will be investigated, the first a study on cosmological implications of the BAO signal by \citet{SanchezScoccola2012}, and the second a more specific BAO extraction from the DR9 dataset found in \citet{AndersonAubourg2012}.

Considering first \citet{SanchezScoccola2012}, the fiducial model utilised is that common flat $\Lambda$CDM model, parametrised with $\Omega_m = 0.274$, $h=0.7$. The same fiducial cosmology is used by \citet{WhiteBlantonBolton2011} and all companion papers \citep{AndersonAubourg2012, ManeraScoccimarro2013, ReidSamushiaWhite2012, RossPercival2012, TojeiroPercivalWake2012}. Like the previous papers investigated, the observed correlation function comes from the use of the \citet{LandySzalay1993} estimator, {\red DETAIL selection function importance in Blake section}, where the randomly generated distribution contained 50 times more objects than original data, and followed same selection function, which is is detailed in\citet{AndersonAubourg2012}. Unlike in \citet{BlakeDavis2011, ChuangWang2012}, the estimator is used to produce a two dimensional cross correlation function $\xi(s,\mu)$, as the survey geometry produces angular dependence on the randomly generated distributions \citep{SamushiaPercivalGuzzo2011, KazinSanchezBlanton2012}.


As the analysis in \citet{SanchezScoccola2012} is concerned with the angle averaged redshift space correlation function, the monopole of the correlation function $\xi(s,\mu)$ is taken:
\begin{align}
\xi(s) = \int_{-1}^1 \xi(s,\mu) d\mu
\end{align}
{\green When computing pair counts, a weight is added in. This is pg 418, right near the end, Ill do more detail if needed, skipping to model}. Covariance in the dataset is estimated using 600 mock catalogues detailed in \citet{ManeraScoccimarro2013}.

Following \citet{SanchezBaughAngulo2008} and \citet{CrocceScoccimarro2008}, their model is given by
\begin{align}
\xi(s) = b^2 \left[ \xi_L(s) \otimes e^{-(k_* s)^2}  + A_{MC} \xi_L'(s) \xi_L^{(1)}(s)   \right],
\end{align}
where $b$, $k_*$ and $A_{MC}$ are free parameters in the model and $\otimes$ denotes convolution. $\xi_L'$ gives the derivative of the linear correlation function $\xi_L$, and $\xi_L'$ is defined as
\begin{align}
\xi_L'(s) \equiv \hat{s} \cdot \nabla^{-1} \xi_L(s) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int P_L(k) j_1(ks) k dk,
\end{align}
where $j_1(ks)$ represents the first order spherical Bessel function. As in prior analyses, $k_*$ is set as a free parameter, as it depends on cosmology, redshift, and galaxy type through its dependence on halo mass. Following \citet{Sanchez2009}, the dataset range is restricted to $40 < s < 200 h^{-1}$Mpc. The model was then given to \textsc{cosmomc} \citep{LewisBridle2002}, where a generalised version of CAMB software \citep{Lewis2000} was used to test a time dependent dark energy equation of state \citep{FangHuLewis2008}, with additional modifications from \citet{KeislerReichardt2011} and \citet{ConleyGuySullivan2011} to compute the likelihood of SPT and SNLS data sets. As with prior studies, the fit distributions obtained from the MCMC fitting are used to provide constraints on cosmological parameters.

{\green bunch of stuff not going into here from sanchez}


Another interesting analysis of the BOSS CMASS DR9 release is given by \citet{AndersonAubourg2012}, and uses a different approach to the analysis by \citet{SanchezScoccola2012}. In particular, \citet{AndersonAubourg2012} reconstructs the BAO peak in an attempt to increase the tightness of cosmological constraints. As detailed in \citet{AndersonAubourg2012}, matter flows and peculiar velocities are the primary source of difference between observed BAO signal and the predictions of linear theory. These flows and peculiar velocities occur on intermediate scales ($\sim 20 h^{-1}$ Mpc), and act to suppress small scale oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum and smooth the BAO feature in the correlation function \citep{EisensteinSeoWhite2007,CrocceScoccimarro2008,Matsubara2008, Matsubara2008Resumming}. \citet{EisensteinSeoSirko2007} suggested that this smoothing can be reversed, whereby the phase information contained in the density field can be used to reconstruct linear behaviour. Reconstruction of linear behaviour can be found in many instances of prior literature \citep{Peebles1989,Peebles1990,Gramann1993,NusserDekel1992} however its application specifically for reconstruction of the BAO peak has not been explored to its greatest capacity. Reconstruction techniques have been used to sharpen the BAO feature found in mock catalogues and datasets \citep{NohWhitePadmanabhan2009, PadmanabhanWhite2009, SeoEckelEisenstein2010, MehtaSeoEckel2011}, and have also been used to sharpen the BAO feature in observed data, such as when \citet{PadmanabhanXuEisenstein2012} applied reconstruction techniques to the SDSS-II LRG sample. For the LRG reconstruction, sharpening of the BAO peak provided a 1.9\% distance measurement at $z=0.35$, decreasing the error by a factor of 1.7 compared with the pre-reconstruction measurement.


Unlike the studies reviewed previously, \citet{AndersonAubourg2012} attempted to reconstruct the BAO peak, following the methodology outlined in \citet{EisensteinSeoSirko2007}, where the potential benefits of reconstruction include undoing the smoothing of the BAO peak accounted for in prior studies and removal of expected bias (of significance approximately $<0.5\%$) that occur from the same process which gives rise to the peak smoothing. For details of the specific steps of reconstructing the BAO peak from survey data, see \citet[Sec. 4.1]{AndersonAubourg2012}.

{\green if I need it, here is summary:

 1. Smooth observed density field to suppress effects of shot-noise and nighly nin-linear features. USe Gaussian of width $l = 154 h^{-1}$Mpc, but results insensitive to this particular choice (see appendex B1). 2. Embed density field into larger volume a constrained Gaussian realization {\green wut}. The correlation function of the constrained Gaussian realization is chosen to match the observed uncreconstructed correlations (but again results insensitive). 3. Estimate the displacements $q$ from galaxy density field $\delta_{gal}$ using continuity equation. 4. Shift galaxies by $-q$. Shift by additional $-f q_s \hat{s}$ where $\hat{s}$ is redshift direction and $f$ is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate with respect to scale factor. This accounts for linear redshift space distortions. Denote field $D$ 5. Generate sample of points, shift by $-q$ denote field $S$. 6. Reconstruction given by difference between $D$ and $S$.}


As with \citet{SanchezScoccola2012}, \citet{AndersonAubourg2012} states that the dataset covariance was recovered from 600 galaxy mock catalogues, as detailed in \citet{ManeraScoccimarro2013}. For more detail, the mocks were generated using a method similar to PTHalos \citep{ScoccimarroSheth2002}, in which second order perturbation theory (2LPT) was used to generate the matter fields corresponding to the fiducial cosmology, and these fields were calibrated using suite of N-body simulations from LasDamas \citep{McBride2011}. The halos were populated with galaxies using a halo occupation distribution as described by \citet{ZhengCoilZehavi2007}. Mocks were then reshaped to fit the survey geometry and modified so as to include redshift-space distortions, follow sky completeness and downsampled to match the radial number density of observed data.

For measuring correlation function, the study also used the \citet{LandySzalay1993} estimator, and their general correlation function fitting methodology is based on the procedures described in \citet{XuPadmanabhan2012}. Their correlation model is given by
\begin{align}
\xi_{\mathrm{fit}}(s) = b^2 \xi_m(\alpha s) + A(s)
\end{align}
where $b^2$ represents the common galaxy bias seen in previous studies, $\alpha$ the horizontal scale factor also seen previously, 
\begin{align} \label{eq:andersongaus}
\xi_m(s) = \int \frac{k^2 dk}{2\pi^2} P_m(k) j_0(k s) e^{-k^2 a^2}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
A(s) = \frac{a_1}{s^2} + \frac{a_2}{s} + a_3,
\end{align}
with $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ being nuisance model parameters to marginalise over the broad band signal in the correlation function that may result from redshift-space distortion, scale dependent bias and incorrect assumptions in fiducial cosmology. A Gaussian dampening term is added toequation \eqref{eq:andersongaus} to damp oscillations in $j_0(ks)$ (first order spherical Bessel function) at high-$k$ to induce better numerical convergence. The scale term $a$ was set to $1 h^{-1}$ Mpc, but found to be insensitive to specific value so long as it corresponded to scales below the scales of interest for the BAO signal. The $P_m(k)$ found in equation \eqref{eq:andersongaus} corresponds to the $P_{\rm{dw,NL}}$ found in \citet{BlakeDavis2011}, and is formally given by \citet{AndersonAubourg2012} as 
\begin{align}
P_m(k) = \left[ P_{\rm{lin}}(k) - P_{\rm{nw}}(k) \right] e^{-k^2 \Sigma_{\rm{NL}}^2 / 2} + P_{\rm{nw}}(k),
\end{align}
following \citet{EisensteinSeoWhite2007}. The $\Sigma_{\rm{NL}}$ given plays an identical role as to the $\sigma_v$ and $k_*$ used in previous literature. Best fit values were found during fitting, and $\Sigma_{\rm{NL}} = 8 h^{-1}$ Mpc in fits to pre-reconstructed data, and $\Sigma_{nl} = 4 h^{-1}$Mpc after reconstruction. Unlike prior studies (which fit for all parameters simultaneously), $\alpha$ was discretized using step size of $\Delta \alpha = 0.001$ in range $0.8 < \alpha < 1.2$, where each $\alpha$ was taken and had its minimum $\chi^2$ value computed by performing a five parameter model fit.

This process was done for both reconstructed and pre-reconstruction datasets, finding respectively $\alpha = 1.024\pm0.016$ and $\alpha = 1.016\pm0.017$, indicating that reconstruction did not help significantly reduce constraints on $\alpha$. In both cases, the strength of the BAO peak was assessed by refitting using a model devoid of the BAO feature, finding $\Delta \chi^2 = 25$, and thus a $> 5\sigma$ detection.

the fact that the BAOs are imprinted on large, linear and quasi-linear scales of the clustering pattern implies that nonlinear BAO distortions are relatively accessible to modelling via perturbation theory or numerical N-body simulations \citep{EisensteinSeoWhite2007,CrocceScoccimarro2008,Matsubara2008}


The 2-point correlation function is a common method for quantifying the clustering of a population of galaxies, in which the distribution of pair separations in the dataset is compared to that within random, unclustered catalogues possessing the same selection function \citep{Peebles1980}.

The BAO signal in the correlation function and power spectrum needs to be modified for non-linear evolution of density fluctuations, redshift-space distortions, and galaxy bias \citep{MeiksinWhitePeacock1999,EisensteinSeoWhite2007,SeoEisenstein2007, AnguloBaugh2008, CrocceScoccimarro2008,  SanchezBaughAngulo2008, SeoSiegelEisenstein2008, SmithScoccimarroSheth2008, GottChoiParkKim2009, KimParkGott2009, KimParkRossiLee2011, MontesanoSanchezPhelps2012}. Renormalization perturbation theory \citep{CrocceScoccimarro2006} have provided substantial progress regarding theoretical understanding of the effects of non linear evolution which can now be accurately modelled \citep{CrocceScoccimarro2006, Matsubara2008Resumming, Matsubara2008, TaruyaNishimichi2009}, and even partially corrected for \citep{EisensteinSeoSirko2007, SeoEckelEisenstein2010, PadmanabhanXuEisenstein2012}. Based on RPT, \citet{CrocceScoccimarro2008} proposed a simple model, \citet{SanchezBaughAngulo2008} showed this yields an excellent description of the resultd of N-body simulations. \citet{Sanchez2009} used this on LRG SDSS DR6 \citep{Adelman2008} data. Same ansatz used by \citet{BlakeKazin2011, BeutlerBlake2011}. Analgous approach used by \citet{MontesanoSanchezPhelps2012} to analyse the SDSS LRG DR7 release \citep{Abazajian2009}.

For 2D BAO, three main sources of anisotropy. It is well known that peculiar motion distorts the correlation function anisotropically \citep{Kaiser1987}. It is also well known that assuming the wrong background cosmology lead to an anisotropic $\xi$ \citep{AlcockPaczynski1979}. What is under appreciated is that gravitational lensing also introduces an anisotropy of its own to the galaxy correlation function \citep{Matsubara2000,HuiGaztanaga2008,HuiGaztanaga2007}.

BAO signal analysis proposed using Band-filtered correlation function by \citet{XuWhite2010}.

``dilation scale" $D_v(z)$ introduced by \citet{EisensteinZehavi2005} (they also introduced acoustic parameter), which reflects relative importance of tangential and radial mods in the angle-averaged BAo measurement \citep{PadmanabhanWhite2008}. Reduces to proper distance in low redshift limit.
